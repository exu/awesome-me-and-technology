# Reactive


## Reactive Streams

Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide a standard for
asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure. This
encompasses efforts aimed at runtime environments (JVM and JavaScript)
as well as network protocols.


## Reactive Systems

Systems built as Reactive Systems are more flexible, loosely-coupled
and scalable. This makes them easier to develop and amenable to
change. They are significantly more tolerant of failure and when
failure does occur they meet it with elegance rather than
disaster. Reactive Systems are highly responsive, giving users
effective interactive feedback.


### Responsive:

The system responds in a timely manner if at all possible. Responsive
systems focus onproviding rapid and consistent response times,
establishing reliable upper bounds so they deliver a consistent
quality of service.

### Resilient:

The system stays responsive in the face of failure.  Resilience is
achieved by replication, containment, isolation and
delegation. The client of a component is not burdened with handling its
failures.

### Elastic:

The system stays responsive under varying workload. Reactive Systems
can react to changes in the input rate by increasing or decreasing the
resources allocated to service these inputs.

### Message Driven:

Reactive Systems rely on asynchronous message-passing to establish a
boundary between components that ensures loose coupling, isolation and
location transparency. Non-blocking communication allows recipients to only
consume resources while active, leading to less system overhead.
